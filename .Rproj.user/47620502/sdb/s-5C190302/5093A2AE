This can be very useful is you need to deliver a csv file for Excel users for example. \n\n## Draw a name \n\nThis function draws popularity graphes for names from the beginning of the XXth century to today. The function takes two arguments : the name and the sex (\"F\" for Female and \"M\" for male).\n\n## Draw names\n\nIf you want to compare the popularity accross time of different names, this function is for you. You just need one parameter : a vector containing as many names you want to compare.\n\n## Multi excel \n\nImporting excel sheets can be sometimes difficult : multi_excel makes it easy for you. Just put your excel file as a parameter to this function and all its sheets will be imported. \n\n## My csv reader\n\nIf you need to read csv files, this functions is the one you needed. You only need to put as a parameter to your function the path to your csv file. \n\n\n\n\n",
